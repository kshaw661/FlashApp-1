##Issues/Observations

1. We have issue while reading the flash library messages. We have writen a sample Flash::write() and Flash::read() code to showcase the issue.

2. In bootstrap Session file we have kept adapater setting as Model which is the file in app\extensions\adapter\session\Model.php

3. We are using the session_set_save_handler function for all the session operations in Model.php file (This is a li3 model adapter file).

4. While trying to read the flash messages, We are getting an issue near _read function (Line no 258). As per the php8 changes the return type of the read method is string, so we have later changed return type with typecasting as string.
You can also please remove the typecasting (string) from the code and check the actual error.

5. We are expecting the issue is somewhere from internal library files.
